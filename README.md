The platform provides probabilities for different types of brain tumors, including:

**Meningioma**: A meningioma is a type of tumor that arises from the meninges, the membranes that surround your brain and spinal cord. These tumors are often benign and grow slowly.

**Pituitary Tumor (Pituitary Adenoma)**: This type of tumor develops in the pituitary gland, a small gland at the base of the brain that produces many hormones.

**Glioma**: Gliomas are tumors that arise from glial cells, which support the function of the brain's nerve cells. They can vary in severity from low-grade to highly aggressive forms.

**No Tumor Detected**: Provides reassurance when no tumor is identified.
